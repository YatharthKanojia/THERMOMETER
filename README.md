This project uses an Arduino and an LM35 temperature sensor to create a digital room thermometer. The temperature readings are displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen. The Arduino reads the analog signal from the LM35 sensor, converts it to a temperature value in Celsius, and displays it on the LCD. The setup includes calibrating the sensor with an offset for accurate readings. The LCD shows the real-time temperature, updated every second.
